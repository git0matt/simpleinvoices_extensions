This extension allows more header and footer options.

In each extension, if a style.css file is found, at templates/default/css it will be loaded into the HTML head section.

For adding a javascript file, each extension, within templates/default/js is tested:

	.If a header.js file is found, it will be loaded into the HTML head section.
	.If a footer.js file is found, it will be loaded in the end of HTML body section.
	.If a script.js file is found, it will be loaded in the end of HTML body section.
	.If a inhead.js file is found, it's contents will be loaded into the HTML head section.
	.If a infoot.js file is found, it's contents will be loaded in the end of HTML body section.
	.If a inline.js file is found, it's contents will be loaded into the HTML head section.

For adding other HTML, each extension, a file templates/default/body.tpl will be loaded in  the HTML body.

Also the login screen will load extension header/footer templates, if exist.
